# AirBeacon

## Project Introduction

AirBeacon is an indoor environment monitoring system designed to continuously monitor and display a range of indoor air quality indicators. This project utilizes an Arduino UNO as the core controller, combined with SCD-30 and MQ-135 sensors to measure levels of carbon dioxide, temperature, humidity, and harmful gases. The data is displayed in real-time on an OLED screen, and the system is equipped with LED lights and a buzzer for warning purposes.

## Features

- **Environmental Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of indoor air for carbon dioxide, temperature, humidity, and harmful gases.
- **Data Display**: Intuitive presentation of environmental data on an OLED display.
- **Warning System**: Alerts through LED lights and a buzzer when environmental indicators exceed safe thresholds.

## Hardware Requirements

### Hardware Assembly:

1. **Component Preparation**:
   - SCD-30 Sensor: Used for measuring carbon dioxide, temperature, and humidity.
   - MQ-135 Sensor: Used for monitoring harmful gases in the air.
   - Arduino UNO: Serves as the main controller.
   - OLED Display: Used for displaying environmental data.
   - LED Lights and Buzzer: Used for the warning system.
