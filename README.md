# ðŸ’¡ AirBeacon

## Project Introduction

AirBeacon is an indoor environment monitoring system designed to continuously monitor and display a range of indoor air quality indicators. This project utilizes an Arduino UNO as the core controller, combined with SCD-30 and MQ-135 sensors to measure levels of carbon dioxide, temperature, humidity, and harmful gases. The data is displayed in real-time on an OLED screen, and the system is equipped with LED lights and a buzzer for warning purposes.
